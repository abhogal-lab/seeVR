- The Base image can be either 3D or 4D
- The Overlay image can can only be 3D
- When the 'Generate Movie' button is pressed, the app will run through the 4D volumes and save a dynamic movie. 
This can be followed by a rotation if the user chooses (default = yes)
- If a 3D image is loaded, only the rotation is generated.
